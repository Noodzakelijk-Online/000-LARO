A lawyer for court proceedings can cost several thousand euros if not eligible for subsidized aid. Subsidized aid requires a co-payment (*eigen bijdrage*). Court fees (*griffierecht*) also apply.",
        "outcomes": "Possible outcomes include: landlord performs repairs, rent reduction granted (temporary or permanent), compensation for damages, termination of the rental agreement (less common). Success depends heavily on evidence and legal grounds."

        "timelines": "Challenging dismissal has strict deadlines (often 2 months to appeal). Court proceedings (*kantonrechter*) can take 3-6 months on average, potentially longer if appealed.",
        "costs": "Legal costs can be substantial. Lawyer fees are the main component. Subsidized aid may be available depending on income. Settlement negotiations might avoid court costs. Court fees apply if proceedings start.",
        "outcomes": "Possible outcomes: dismissal upheld, dismissal overturned (reinstatement or fair compensation - *billijke vergoeding*), settlement agreement reached (e.g., severance pay - *transitievergoeding* plus potential extra amount). Outcome depends on whether the employer followed correct procedures and had valid grounds."
