# Legal AI Platform - Development To-Do List (Phase 3)

## Phase 1: Universal Case ID System & Core Enhancements
- [X] **Analyze Universal Case ID Requirements**: Gather and clarify user needs for a universal case ID system capable of linking multiple sub-case IDs from various parties.
- [X] **Design Universal Case ID Architecture**: Create a detailed architectural design for the UCID system, including data models, generation logic, linking mechanisms, and search functionalities.
- [X] **Research Dutch Legal Data Sources**: Investigate `wetten.overheid.nl`, `uitspraken.rechtspraak.nl`, `linkeddata.overheid.nl` (LiDO), and `data.overheid.nl` to understand data availability, formats, and access methods (APIs, data dumps, SRU services) for legislation and court rulings.
- [X] **Design Data Ingestion Pipeline**: Based on the research, design a robust pipeline for ingesting, processing, and storing Dutch legal data (legislation from "Basis Wetten Bestand" and court rulings, likely via LiDO or other methods).
- [X] **Design Email Integration Architecture**: Design the architecture for integrating user email accounts (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) for the Lawyer Outreach feature, focusing on authentication (OAuth), security, and API interactions.

## Phase 2: Implementation
- [X] **Implement Universal Case ID System**: Develop the backend and database components for the UCID system as per the designed architecture.
- [X] **Develop Data Processing for Legal Documents**: Implement the data ingestion pipeline, including parsers for XML/RDF, SRU client for updates, and data transformation logic for the Knowledge Hub.
- [X] **Implement Email Integration for Lawyer Outreach**: Develop the functionality for users to connect their email accounts and for the system to send emails on their behalf.
- [X] **Enhance Knowledge Hub for Integrated Content**: Update the Knowledge Hub frontend and backend to effectively display and utilize the deeply integrated Dutch legal content.
## Phase 3: Testing & Deployment
- [ ] **Test Universal Case ID Functionality**: Thoroughly test all aspects of the UCID system, including generation, linking, search, and retroactive processing.
- [ ] **Test Email Integration Functionality**: Test the email integration with various providers, ensuring secure authentication and reliable email sending.
- [ ] **Test Legal Content Integration**: Verify the accuracy, completeness, and searchability of the integrated Dutch legal data in the Knowledge Hub.
- [ ] **Deploy Enhanced Platform**: Prepare the final deployment package and deploy the fully enhanced platform to the production environment.

## Notes
- This to-do list reflects the plan updated on May 11, 2025, incorporating new requirements for Universal Case ID, deep legal data integration, and email integration for lawyer outreach.
